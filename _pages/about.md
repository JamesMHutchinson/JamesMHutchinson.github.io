Hi, I'm Jimmy. In December 2024 I graduated with a B.S. in Pure and Applied Mathematics with a minor in Economics from the College of Coastal Georgia (CCGA). I'm a supplemental instructor and math tutor at CCGA, and I'm applying to math Ph.D. programs for Fall 2026.

My current research interest is in fractals, specifically considering images of functions whose domain is a fractal. You can see more in the [research interest](/researchinterest/) tab.

I also like game nights with friends and hiking.

Feel free to look around my website, and you can find my email below.
