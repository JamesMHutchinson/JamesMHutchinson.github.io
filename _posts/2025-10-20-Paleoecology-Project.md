The College of Coastal Georgia (CCGA) has a small fossil lab where they study and classify microfossils from Clark Quarry, Brunswick, GA. I worked with Emma Robison, an environmental science student who is a member of the fossil lab. We took the lab's data, calculated several biodiversity measures, and compared it with fossil data of the surrounding states. The estimated fossil deposition dates for Clark Quarry are of interest because they're in the Late Pleistocene when many megafauna went extinct and overlaps with the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM).

The poster was presented at the Georiga Resiliency Conference 2025 and is accepted to be presented at the American Geophysical Union conference in December 2025.

There are many moving parts when studying the paleoclimate/ecology of the southeastern United States between 15-60 thousand years ago, and I'm grateful to have had the opportunity to work with the fossil lab.
