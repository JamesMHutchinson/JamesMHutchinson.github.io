I was fortunate enough to attend the CURE 2023 REU hosted by Illinois State University. After the experience, we picked advisors and made the below poster. It was a fun exercise in differential equations modeling, and it was presented at the 16th Annual International Symposium on Biomathematics and Ecology Education and Research (BEER) at Virginia Commonwealth University in November 2023, as well as the CCGA SOURCE conference in April 2024.
