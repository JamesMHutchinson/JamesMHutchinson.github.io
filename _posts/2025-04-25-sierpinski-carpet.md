        I submitted my poster project on the Sierpiński Carpet to the 2025 CCGA Endeavor Conference, and I was invited to give an oral presentation. I obliged, and gave a 10-minute presentation on April 24th (<a href="{{ '/assets/pdf/Endeavor 10min Presentation.pptx' | relative_url }}">you can download the slides here</a>). Then on April 25th, I attended the poster session with my poster. The main goal was to get a handle on how to describe fractals mathematically, and I think the most satisfying answer was with Iterated Function Systems (IFS's). With the slideshow, I was able to animate the difference in constructing the Sierpiński Carpet with the usual deletion scheme versus the IFS. The Sierpiński Carpet is the unique fixed set under the IFS given in the poster.
